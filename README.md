## Structure and Technologies

### Frontend 

The Frontend is developped with ReactJS as Javascript Framework. 
We used React Router Dom, Redux and JS-Cookies as library. 
The Music player is create with the library "React Player".
> Note that we decided to use the less library possible to improve the performence of the app. 

To design the app we firstly worked on Figma to imagine the general design we wanted, you can find the figma project [here](https://www.figma.com/file/TYdq8YKo6sswOr882mEXQ0/Detective-Music?node-id=0%3A1&t=CLtN9zWoIUYUSKmK-1).
> Note that the project is prototype and was modified during the coding part. 

All The Website was design without framework, only using SCSS.

The Frontend is host with Vercel.

You can find the full frontend project here or click on the submodules at the top: https://github.com/alchambron/Frontend-Music-Detective

### Backend

For the Back End we used Ruby on Rails as API. 
The database is on PostgreSQL.
We used the gem "Yt", to fetch data easily on the backend and saved the song on base. 

The Backend is host with Heroku.
